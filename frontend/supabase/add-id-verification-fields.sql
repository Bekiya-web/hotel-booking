A customer dashboard is a personal user area where guests can manage everything related to their bookings. It includes features like viewing current and past reservations, checking check-in and check-out details, tracking payments, updating profile information, receiving notifications, and managing cancellations or changes. It gives users full control without needing to contact the hotel directly.
